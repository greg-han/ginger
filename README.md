This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## DEAR READER
This app is structured such that you need to first click on search in order to find the relevant articles.
AFTER you have clicked on search, you can then navigate and check the requirements as necessary.
I understand that it is a bit sloppy, but I did this in roughly 7.5 hours because I have term projects and midterms right now.
